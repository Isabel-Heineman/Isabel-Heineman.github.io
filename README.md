# **About Me**

## Where can you find me when I’m not attached to my computer?

* __In the garden__

	In the words of Doug Green:

>	I am more myself in a garden than anywhere else on Earth.

  * Painting and drawing  
  * Quilling is new to me this year 
* __Gaming__  
	 I’m finding this comes on multiple platforms like video games and board games. 
* __Hanging out with my family and friends__  
	 Whether this is through travel, get togethers, movies, or hikes, I enjoy quality time with the people I care about.
* __Cooking__  
	 Lately, this has been new to me dinners. I've been coooking since I was in elementary school. New recipes with international ingredients have intrigued me. However, baking is beginning to take shape and moving into a new hobby.

## When online, I recommend using these websites:
* [__Youtube__](https://www.youtube.com/)- I have found YouTube perfect for quick tutorials on everything from music, gaming, cooking to art, photography, and sports. It also helps me catch up on current events I may have missed.
* [__ChatGPT__]( https://chatgpt.com/)- This tool makes it easier to forecast a plan , find resources, and understand topics I don’t fully grasp. 
* [__Extension Services__](https://emgv.ces.ncsu.edu/)- I refer often to our local extension services for sustainability and best gardening practices with an emphasis on native pollinators and edibles found in our area. It helps me plan with a higher success rate each season.
